# Todo-List
I have a created a  simple Todo List project with the help of HTML,CSS and Javascript. You can add your daily tasks you want to do in your daily routine. My project show your added task in the table form. When you want to add a task, you only have to enter the title  to your task and the description of your task and click on "Add Task". The Table will show the title you given to the  task, description of the task, the time when you entered the task and at last a button is given which symbols the completion of the task. When you will complete the task, you can click on that button and that task will be deleted from your Todo List. I have created one more button named "Clear List". When you want to clear the list, you click on that button. But if mistakenly clicked on that button, their will come a comfirmation window. So, if you want to clear the list click ok and the list will be cleared. Above table their is a "Total Tasks" option which the total number of tasks in the table.
